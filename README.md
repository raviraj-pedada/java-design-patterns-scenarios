# Java Design Patterns – Scenario-Based Implementations

## Overview
This repository is a hands-on learning resource for **Java design patterns**, implemented using **realistic scenarios** to help understand how patterns are applied in software development.

**Purpose of this repo:**
- Learn design patterns in a **practical, scenario-based approach**.
- Understand **why and when** to use each pattern.
- Practice **Java coding best practices**.
- Build a strong **portfolio for resumes and interviews**.

---

## Learning Approach
Each pattern in this repository is implemented using the following methodology:

1. **Problem Statement** – What problem the pattern solves.
2. **Real-World Analogy** – An intuitive analogy.
3. **Java Implementation** – Scenario-based code examples.
4. **Variations** – Multiple approaches where applicable.
5. **Demo / App Runner** – Example `main()` class to demonstrate usage.
6. **Documentation** – Each pattern folder has a `README.md` with explanations and key takeaways.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-design-patterns-scenarios.git
2. Open in your preferred IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode).
3. Navigate to the desired pattern folder (e.g., `singleton/`).
4. Run the demo class (e.g., `SingletonApp.java`) to see the pattern in action.
